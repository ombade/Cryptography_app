## Features
- **AES Encryption**: Encrypt text using AES algorithm with a user-defined secret key.
- **AES Decryption**: Decrypt the encrypted text back to its original form using the same secret key.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI with fields for input text and secret key.
- **Dynamic Encryption**: Customizable encryption using a dynamic key, making the encryption process secure.



## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language for the Android app.
- **XML**: UI design with a clean and modern layout.
- **Android Studio**: Development environment.
- **AES Encryption**: AES algorithm implemented for secure data encryption and decryption.
